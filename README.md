# InstaUsers

My dear friend and I, have been discussing the concept of `APIs`, then we developed this page together to make it easier for him to explain the concept to me :).
Its basically a web page that let you enter any Instagram Account username and return an information about the given account. Returned information like: account profile photo, followers number, is it private account or public, is it verified account or not.

## Page Stayle

We have used Bootstrap for cards that contains an account information and for style overall.

## Instagram API

We have used jQuery library to dealing with the JSON file that an instagram API return.
`https://www.instagram.com/web/search/topsearch/?context=blended&query=` + any username of instagram account.
